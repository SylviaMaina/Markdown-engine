# Markdown Engine

---

I wanted to make the code as simple as possible and as readable as possible.

The program was created with the help of a repository that was installed from the npmjs website and installed to the app.

I got the idea from a quick google search on repositories that change markdown text to html.

The code only works to change markdown text to HTML.

I tried to make code copied to the engine in markdown language highlighted by installing a repository to do just that but unfortunately it did not work so I ommited it all together.

Code entered to the engine is still transformed to HTML but it is not highlighted.
